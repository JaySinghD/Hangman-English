# Hangman â€“ Java Desktop Game

An interactive **Hangman** game built in **Java** using **NetBeans**, featuring a fully fledged graphical interface, multiple screens, and persistent player data.

---

## Overview
This project was my **final project for the ICS4U Grade 12 Computer Science course**.  
It was a **self-directed project**, designed, built, and completed independently in **June 2023** during my final year of high school.

The program provides a fun and engaging way to play Hangman while demonstrating key programming principles such as **object-oriented design**, **data persistence**, and **UI interaction**.

## Features
- **Interactive UI** with multiple pop-ups, menus, and game screens  
- **Custom graphics** for a dynamic user experience  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** architecture for modular, maintainable code  
- **Persistent leaderboard** stored in an XML file. The player scores are saved even after closing the program  
- Built entirely in **Java (NetBeans IDE)**
